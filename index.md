# Welcome

My name is Alex

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Riverside (UCR) working on Phylogenomics of Reduvioidea. Feel free to visit my page on [the Dr. Weirauch's Website](https://heteroptera.ucr.edu/index.php/people/knyshov)

One of my research interests is high-throughput data processing, particularly dealing with the DNA sequencing data. This web site will host some of the bioinformatic tools I use in my research.
