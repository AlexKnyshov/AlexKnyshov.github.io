# Welcome

Hi! My name is Alex. I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Biomedical Genetics section in the Department of Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. My current work focuses on applying computational methods to RNA sequencing data with the aim of discovering the links between genes and complex human diseases.

Among my research interests is a high-throughput DNA and RNA sequence data processing. This web site will reference some of the bioinformatic tools I use in my research. [This repository](https://github.com/AlexKnyshov/main_repo) is my main storage of (mostly) utility scripts, primarily written in Python and R. Specific bioinformatic tools and projects have their own repositories and can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexKnyshov).

I am also interested in helping others to process data in phylogenetic context and organized a series of workshops on phylogenetic and bioinformatic methods for my former labmates at UC Riverside. Transfer of the prepared materials to this website is WIP, but some of the tutorials can already be found in [Python]({{ site.url }}/Py_pages.html) and [R]({{ site.url }}/R_pages.html) sections.

Further details can be found in my [CV]({{ site.url }}/KnyshovCV.pdf).
